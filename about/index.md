Hi. I'm Matt Swanson.

I'm a software engineer who values light-weight agile processes, TDD, and good design, but above all: shipping.

I enjoy building simple apps that people love using.

I live and [work](http://www.sep.com/) in Indianapolis, IN. I went to school at [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu/) and did a BS in [Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE). I do a little bit of everything, but I'm happiest working with Ruby or Android.

I think of myself as a ["T-shaped developer"](http://www.mdswanson.com/blog/2013/07/30/on-t-shaped-people.html): depth of experience in a few areas and enough breadth that I can ship a complete app on my own if need be.

I come at problems with an Engineer's Mindset and am always striving to write clean, readable code.

I prefer doing test-first development, but know that it is not the right tool for every project. 

I'm always learning and trying to improve my craft; I consider writing software to be one of my most enjoyable hobbies and usually have some kind of side-project I'm hacking on.

I run a monthly newsletter for Indiana developers ([Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/)) and organize a weekly "get stuff done" group ([Indy Startup Lab](http://indystartuplab.org)). I'm a regular speaker at the local Ruby meetup ([IndyRB](http://indyrb.org)). I also help run a just-for-fun table tennis league for tech companies in the Indianapolis area ([ITTTL](http://itttl.org)). I spearheaded an [internal "Startup Weekend" event](http://www.sep.com/labs/startupweekend/) at SEP that has been going on for three years now.

I watch way too much TV.
