**What's the point?**  
This book provides a step-by-step guide for planning and writing a successful technical
blog. Additionally, the author describes how to get the most benefit from your blog.
 
**How was it?**  
I think someone new to blogging would get a lot out of this book. That being said, I did
not find it to be that useful for me.
 
The book starts by helping you plan out what your blog is going to be. By answering a
series of questions (will your blog be niche or general? will you write essays or
tutorials?), you can narrow down your focus and figure out a plan for maintaining and
growing your blog.
 
Near the end of the book was where I started finding practical advice that I could use.
The book covers a wide range of monetization strategies (ads, sponsorships, affiliate
links), but more importantly, also talked about some of the other benefits you get from
blogging (building an audience, becoming an expert in the field).
 
**Who should read it?**  
Overall, I think the book would be very useful for someone interested in blogging that
didn't know where to begin. For people that already have a blog, you can probably skim a
few of the later sections and skip the rest.
