#[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)#  
Andrew Hunter and David Thomas  
ISBN: 020161622X


**What's the point?**
Code better.  It is hard to succinctly summarize this book because it is packed with good information.  It is a look into the 'core process' of software development.  There is a good mix of soft skills such as working on a team and career development and technical guidance for writing solid and flexible code.

**How was it?**
I read this book with a book club and I really enjoyed it.  Our group had some really good discussions that really complimented the book well.  It was the perfect book to read during the first months as a *real* professional developer.

**Who should read it?**
I think it should be given to any new grad upon finishing school, if not sooner -- its that good.  Its a classic that I would recommend to anyone who writes code or manages a software team.

Notes: I switched off between a hard copy and my Kindle; while most of the sections are ebook friendly, there are some code snippets that don't always translate well.
