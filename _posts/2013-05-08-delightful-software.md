You've probably heard or read somewhere about [delighting your customers][delight].

A small pleasant surprise can convert someone into a [die-hard fanatic][sierra].

I ordered this [belt][mission] (after seeing it on Shark Tank) and when I opened the package
I received this hand-written note. It took someone 20 seconds to do but it made me
smile.

I recently did a bit of contract work for a [coffee shop][gh]. Here's what I got in the
mail after the project was completed:

Are you frickin' kidding me? A hand-calligraphified box? Filled with awesome stuff?

Think I'll have to hem and haw about doing more work with them in the future? Nope.

I am a firm believer in the idea (some are not), but it always seemed like something
that was out-of-reach. Sure, Disney or Zappos or 37signals can delight! It's in
their DNA and culture! I can't find a place to delight my users...

You know what? It's not that hard.

Delighting customers requires a bit of nuance, but you can do it. You don't have to 
be some UX prodigy or take a calligraphy class.

I started making a deliberate effort to include surprises and it has been fun. Not
only do I put a smile on the face of users, but I actually feel happier working on
the projects. One stupid little joke changes my whole attitude and motivation towards
progressing on the app.

Here's three examples from projects of mine: 

I asked five co-workers to write down 10 phrases that meant "good job". I picked the
best ones and added a random "kudos" message to our [employee happiness app][morale].

In my [TV episode tracker][queuerunner], when you run out of items to watch - you 
receive this playful jab.

QueueRunner TV zero / now go outside

When I started building my [anti-social RSS reader][stringer], one of the first things I added
was this self-aware message in the footer.

Your homework: add something delightful to your project. No, seriously, do it.
