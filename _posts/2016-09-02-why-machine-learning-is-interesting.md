It's been five years since Marc Andreeseen proclaimed that "software is eating the world". And he was right. Almost every person I talk to is using software as part of their job.

When software started eating the world, there was a lot of low-hanging fruit. First, all the paper was removed. Even rec sports leagues stopped being managed over the phone or on paper. An approach to creating software products was to take an Excel sheet that was emailed back and forth and turn it into a SaaS product.

And this progress was, for the most part, great.

But it's been five years.

The stuff that was easy to turn into software has been turned into software. What remains is the hard stuff. The hard stuff is the expert, often tacit knowledge. While the current wave of software can make us more efficient, it struggles to make us more effective.

Maybe 15 years ago, a manager was delighted to have electronic tool to track project status. And five years ago, they were delighted by a beautiful interface and powerful reports they could create. But now, to delight them we need software to anticipate problems before the manager even knows about it.

The problems to solve for customers are changing. A beautiful, functional product is table-stakes. Customers want prediction, insights, and recommendations.

And for that, we need machine learning.

Software has eaten the world because it provided value and solved problems. If we want software to keep providing more value and solving more problems, we have to shift toward building things that bring expert knowledge into our code.
